====== TDT4258 Energy Efficient Computer Design ======

In TDT4258 Energy Efficient Computer Design you learn the basic techniques for constructing energy efficient computer systems. These techniques leverage the hardware resources available in current processors. Consequently, we first need to master the art of low-level programming. This is a basic skill for a computer scientist with broad applications in Norwegian and international industry. TDT4258 take a hands-on approach to the subject matter, and practical work accounts for 50% of the grade in the course. 

**Note: Most of the information for the course will be distributed through these pages, but we will also use it's learning**
