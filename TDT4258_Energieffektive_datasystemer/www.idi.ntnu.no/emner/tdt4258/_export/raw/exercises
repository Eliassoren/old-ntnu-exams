===== Compendium =====

  * {{:kompendium.pdf|Compendium 2013}}

Note on Exercise 2: some libraries are now slightly different from the description in the compendium (check the slides for Exercise 2). For that reason, when you declare and use variables for Power Management and ABDAC, you have to change it as follows.

Power Management to be used by ABDAC:

volatile avr32_pm_t *sm = &AVR32_PM (instead of Volatile avr32_sm_t *sm = &AVR32_SM)

sm->gcctrl … (instead of sm->pm_gcctrl)


ABDAC:

volatile avr32_abdac_t *dac = AVR32_ABDAC (instead of Volatile avr32_dac_t *dac = AVR32_DAC)

Please read carefully the documentation regarding sleep levels before using the sleep function on avr32.
If you use "deep sleep levels", it may happen that the board will become unusable (unless reprogrammed) and you may not be able to awake the microprocessor, even with interrupts.
